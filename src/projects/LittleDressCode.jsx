        <h3>â­‘ Creating a mobile app that blends fashion and tech</h3>
        <p>
          Over the course of the semester, our team followed a full product
          development cycle. The process was a combination of product design,
          software engineering, and user research.

        <p>
          Specifically, this project involved exploration of the following
          areas:

        <ol>
          <li>User Research (Weeks 1 â€“ 2)</li>
          <li>Organization & Data Structure (Weeks 2 â€“ 4)</li>
          <li>Wireframing & Prototyping (Weeks 4 â€“ 8)</li>
          <li>Technical Implementation (Weeks 5 â€“ 12)</li>
          <li>Showcase & Reflection (Week 12)</li>

        <h3>â­‘ We began by analyzing scope & brainstorming</h3>

        <p>
          How might we simplify navigation while showcasing outfits &
          collections? How might we create a clean, engaging interface? How
          might we encourage community-driven outfit inspiration in the app?
          These are just a few of the questions that guided our initial
          analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
          What our initial research and brainstorming revealed about how users
          want to interact with LDC:

        <p>
          The true challenge isnâ€™t storing clothes, itâ€™s helping users navigate
          them. Our insight was that effortless navigation, not more features,
          is what makes a closet app useful.

      <div className="project-main-content">
        <h3>â­‘ Next, we spent time considering the organization of the app</h3>

        <p>
          We began with a competitive analysis and peer interviews to understand
          how people intuitively organize their clothes. A 3-tier system (items,
          outfits, and collections) emerged as both natural and flexible. We
          also defined metadata attributes at each level to allow for filtering
          and tagging.

        <p>
          The following sections summarize the research that guided our appâ€™s
          organization. Together, these findings shaped the 3-tier system of
          items, outfits, and collections that underpins our design.

        <h3>â­‘ Brainstormingâ€“with a focus on simplicity</h3>

        <p>
          We explored multiple wireframe iterations and user flows to strip the
          app down to its essentials. Our goal was to balance clarity and
          functionality, making it easy for users to log in, navigate their
          closet, and create outfits without friction.

        <h3>â­‘ Prototyping the core experience</h3>

        <p>
          With our wireframes as a foundation, we began creating the
          high-fidelity prototypes. Prototyping allowed us to test flows quickly
          and refine how users interacted with their closets.
