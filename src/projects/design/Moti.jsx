          Many individuals struggle to maintain consistency with daily
          meditation. Factors such as busy schedules, lacking motivation, and
          not seeing results right away can hinder a personâ€™s ability to develop
          their own mindfulness routine.{" "}

          that encourages individuals to develop these essential mindfulness
          habits. By providing motivation tools, such as daily reminders and
